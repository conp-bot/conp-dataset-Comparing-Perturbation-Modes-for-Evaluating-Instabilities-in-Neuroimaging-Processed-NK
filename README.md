## Description

The processed subset of the NKI-RS dataset for evaluation of various perturbation modes when studying instabilities. Linked to the [pre-print found here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10922), can be visualized using the [plotting code here](https://github.com/gkiar/stability-mca/blob/master/code/dipy_exploratory/mca_dipy_exploratory_analysis.ipynb), and generated with various [scripts and launch configurations found here](https://github.com/gkiar/stability/tree/master/code/experiments/paper0_comparing_perturbation_modes).
